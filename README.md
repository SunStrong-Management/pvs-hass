## Overview

This integration allows you to monitor a PVS system via a companion Python library `pypvs`. The latter accesses
an instance of `varserver` running on the PVS via the recently made available PVS FCGI API. The user has access to a list
of publicly available varserver variables for telemetry and basic information about the PVS.

More information about the varserver platform is available at https://github.com/tjmonk/varserver.
The `pypvs` library is available at https://github.com/SunStrong-Management/pypvs.

## Prerequisites

- PVS firmware version 61839 or above

- A recent installation of Home Assistant
- HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) installed
- The PVS connected to your network via Wi-Fi or Ethernet

Please note that previous workarounds using an intermediate device connected to the LAN port of the PVS are not needed,
and probably should be removed altogether.

## Installation

1. Install Home Assistant on your target system https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/
2. Install HACS https://www.hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/download/
3. Add this Repo to HACS by going to the 3 dots on the right ...-> Custom repositories ->
 Repository: `SunStrong-Management/pvs-hass` Category: `Integration`
4. Install this integration in HACS searching for `PVS` (using the latest release is recommended)
5. Restart Home Assistant
6. In the Home Assistant UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "PVS".
   * The main configuration is `<IP/Hostname>[:port]`. Check your router configuration for the IP of your PVS


## Options (available from 'configure' once integration is setup)

### Data update interval (seconds)

This sets how fast the integration will try to get updated info from the PVS.


## Devices

### Gateway

This is the data from the PVS Gateway device. These sensors provide diagnostic and usage information about the gateway itself.

## Debugging

### Installed through HACS but I can't find it in the integrations list

Some people seem to have a browser caching / refresh issue it seems to be solved by completely
clearing caches or using another browser.

## Credits

This integration is based on the work of the following projects:

- [krbaker/hass-sunpower](https://github.com/krbaker/hass-sunpower)
- [home-assistant/integration-enphase_envoy](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/enphase_envoy/)

Please note that this integration is not a continuation of the above projects, but rather a separate implementation inspired by them.
Thus, transitioning, for example, from the `hass-sunpower` integration is not possible, and users will need to just use this
integration as a replacement.
